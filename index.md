# Howdy, pilgrim.

I am writing bio for my personal page. I have following text, can you help me to make it better and more interesting? : I am Jaroslav and I am currently a PhD student in the [Netmon](https://netmon.fit.cvut.cz) research group. We work in the field of network traffic monitoring and analysis. Right now I am mostly interested into scalable monitoring infrastructure (with custom FPGA, DPDK technology, etc.), statistics in the field of computer networks and application of machine learning in the same field. 

I feel that part of my duty is to educate others; so I also teach and sometimes I create a blogpost.
